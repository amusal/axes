## view definition of remote server in your repository
>> git remote -v
    origin git://git.com/app.git (fetch)
    origin git://git.com/app.git (push)
when push or pull like this:
>> git pull origin master
the 'origin' equals 'git://git.com/app.git', so we know
origin is just an alias of 'git://git.com/app.git'


## push to remote server
>> git push origin master
This command push the local branch 'master' to branch 'master' of
remote server 'origin'.
Let's see the command format:
>> git push <remoteServerRef> <localBranchName>:<remoteBranchName>
remoteServerRef: reference of remote server, usually it is 'origin'
localBranchName: appoint pushing which branch to remote server
remoteBranchName: appoint pushing local branch to which branch of remote server
Usually we use an omitted form:
>> git push origin master
this command equals to command:
>> git push origin master:master
So, do you understand this command?


## pull from remote server
>> git pull origin master
OK, Let's have a review to command push format:
>> git push <remoteServerRef> <localBranchName>:<remoteBranchName>
I will tell you command 'pull' is almost the same as 'push':
>> git pull <remoteServerRef> <localBranchName>:<remoteBranchName>
I think you have got it, haven't you?
